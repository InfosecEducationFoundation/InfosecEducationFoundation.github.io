## Conference Information
 
We are expanding the number of camping spaces our numbers this year, as we want to make sure it is safe, and still allows people to be outside and enjoy the environment.<br />

We will be at [Tolt-McDonald Campground](https://kingcounty.gov/services/parks-recreation/parks/parks-and-natural-lands/popular-parks/toltmacdonald.aspx) in Carnation, Washington. ([Map](https://goo.gl/maps/7y4gaSK1Yutncqcu7))<br />

We'll be making sure everyone can still enjoy themselves. We have speaking slots, a 120 inch projector screen and projector, and we'll have some excellent talks. So bring your tents, rent an RV, and come have some fun. If you require electrical power, all camp spots will have RV hookups, so bring your electric griddles, CPAP machines, or even your EVs and have a good time.<br />

You can [order a tee shirt online](https://art-by-nukabelle.myshopify.com/); if you place an order for a ticket we will send you a discount code for your tee shirt<br />

## Camping Information
Camping tickets provide a campsite for both Friday & Saturday night.<br />
<br />
Camping tickets are per-person, not per-tent, as they include conference admission as well and Tolt MacDonald limits the number of people who can stay at each campsite.  Each site includes a picnic table and fire ring. If you plan to bring your RV, make sure you choose the RV ticket.<br />
<br />
Each campsite at Tolt will have up to two tents and four people. When you purchase tickets, you can purchase two or four camping tickets together to automatically get slotted into the same tent space, or reach out to the organizers to have us place you together at the same camp site by emailing bryan.brake at infoseceducationfoundation.com <br />
<br />
Note that alcohol is NOT allowed within Tolt MacDonald Park. <br />

There are bathrooms and showers on site near the campsites.  All campsites we reserved have hydrant for water and firerings. Grocery store has wood usually, but you can get some at gas stations as well.   <br />

Power: NEMA 6-50 and 14-50 hookups (standard RV or tesla hookups if you use the mobile charger), as well as 2 120 volt standard connectors. If someone needs a CPAP, 25-50 foot extension cord is advisable, as they may not be close to the plugin.  <br />

Camping spots were spacious. Technically, the max people in each space is 4 adults, 4 kids, we had several spots with an RV, plus a tent and plenty of room. <br />
