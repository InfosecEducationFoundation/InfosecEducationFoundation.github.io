We are expanding the number of camping spaces this year. This will allow us to expand and keep people safe and enjoy the great outdoors.<br />

[Tolt-MacDonald Campground](https://kingcounty.gov/services/parks-recreation/parks/parks-and-natural-lands/popular-parks/toltmacdonald.aspx) is located in Carnation, Washington. About 40 minutes outside of Seattle on Route 202. ([Map](https://goo.gl/maps/7y4gaSK1Yutncqcu7))<br />

We'll be making sure everyone can still enjoy themselves. We have speaking slots, a 120 inch projector screen and projector, and we'll have some excellent talks. So bring your tents, rent an RV, and come have some fun. If you require electrical power, all camp spots will have RV hookups, so bring your electric griddles, CPAP machines, or even your EVs to camp in (Bryan will be camping in his Model 3...) <br />

You can order a tee shirt online ([Square Store](https://infoseccampout.square.site/)); if you purchase a ticket, we'll send you a disccount code the site where you can order merchandise or the official t-shirt.<br />

## Camping Information
Camping tickets provide a campsite for both Friday & Saturday night.<br />
<br />
Camping tickets are per-person, not per-tent, as they include conference admission as well and Tolt MacDonald limits the number of people who can stay at each campsite.  Each site includes a picnic table and fire ring. If you plan to bring your RV, make sure you choose the RV ticket.<br />
<br />
Each campsite at Tolt will have up to two tents and four people. When you purchase tickets, you can purchase two or four camping tickets together to automatically get slotted into the same tent space, or reach out to the organizers to have us place you together at the same camp site by emailing bryan.brake at infoseceducationfoundation.com <br />
<br />
Note that alcohol is NOT allowed within Tolt MacDonald Park. <br />

There are bathrooms and showers on site near the campsites.  All campsites we reserved have hydrant for water and firerings. Grocery store has wood usually, but you can get some at gas stations as well.   <br />

Power: NEMA 6-50 and 14-50 hookups (standard RV or tesla hookups if you use the mobile charger), as well as 2 120 volt standard connectors. If someone needs a CPAP, 25-50 foot extension cord is advisable, as they may not be close to the plugin.  <br />

Camping spots were spacious. Technically, the max people in each space is 4 adults, 4 kids, we had several spots with an RV, plus a tent and plenty of room. <br />
