# Welcome to the Infosec Campout 



## Due to Covid-19 pandemic, we are cancelling all activities concerning the Infosec Campout for 2020. All Tickets through Eventbrite have been refunded. If you have any questions, please reach out to our twitter handle @infoseccampout or email bryan.brake@infoseceducationfoundation.com <br />

## Please find our Social Contract [here](Social_contract.md)

## Conference Information
As of 20 July 2020, This conference is cancelled. Covid related closures make the campsite unable to be opened, and lack of large gatherings at this time do not make for a safe environment for a conference. 

## Camping Information
Two types of camping sites are available. "Deluxe" campsites have power and water, while non-deluxe ones do not. Camping tickets provide a campsite for both Friday & Saturday night.<br />
<br />
Camping tickets are per-person, not per-tent, as they include conference admission as well and Tolt MacDonald limits the number of people who can stay at each campsite.  Each site includes a picnic table and fire ring. <br />
<br />
Each campsite at  Tolt will have up to two tents and four people. When you purchase tickets, you can purchase two or four camping tickets together to automatically get slotted into the same tent space, or reach out to the organizers to have us place you together at the same camp site by emailing bryan.brake at infoseceducationfoundation.com <br />
<br />
Note that alcohol is NOT allowed within Tolt MacDonald Park. <br />
